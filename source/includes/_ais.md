# AISP Access

API access for companies authorised as AISPs under PSD2.

This API is a limited subset of the *developer api*. Unlike the *developer api*, we'll keep it stable so it can be used for services provided to all Monzo customers.

You do not have to have a Monzo account to apply for a `client_id` and `secret`.

In the future we may implement the [Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk) API, as well as a more fully featured *V2 Developer API*.

To apply for a `client_id` as an Authorised AISP contact openbanking@monzo.com.

Only firms which have been authorised by their local regulator will be granted access.

## List accounts

Returns a list of accounts owned by the currently authorised user.

```shell
$ http "https://api.monzo.com/ais/accounts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```

```json
{
    "accounts": [
        {
            "id": "acc_00009237aqC8c5umZmrRdh",
            "description": "Peter Pan's Account",
            "created": "2015-11-13T12:17:42Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

To filter by either prepaid or current account, add `account_type` as a url parameter.
Only `uk_retail` `account_type`s are visible on the AIS API.

```shell
$ http "https://api.monzo.com/ais/accounts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "account_type=uk_retail"
```

## Read balance

Returns a customer's account balance.

```shell
$ http "https://api.monzo.com/ais/balance" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "account_id=$account_id"
```

```json
{
	"balance": 5000,
	"currency": "GBP",
	"spend_today": 0
}
```

## Transactions

Transactions are movements of funds into or out of an account. Negative transactions represent debits (ie. *spending* money) and positive transactions represent credits (ie. *receiving* money).

Most properties on transactions are self-explanatory. We'll eventually get around to documenting them all, but in the meantime let's discuss the most interesting/confusing ones:

##### Properties

<span class="hide">Property</span> | <span class="hide">Description</span>
-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------
`amount`         | The amount of the transaction in minor units of `currency`. For example pennies in the case of GBP. A negative amount indicates a debit (most card transactions will have a negative amount)
`decline_reason` | **This is only present on declined transactions!** Valid values are `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `CARD_INACTIVE`, `CARD_BLOCKED` or `OTHER`.
`is_load`        | Top-ups to an account are represented as transactions with a positive amount and `is_load = true`. Other transactions such as refunds, reversals or chargebacks may have a positive amount but `is_load = false`
`settled`        | The timestamp at which the transaction [settled](http://blog.unibulmerchantservices.com/authorization-clearing-and-settlement-of-mastercard-transactions/). In most cases, this happens 24-48 hours after `created`. If this field is not present, the transaction is authorised but not yet "complete."
`category`       | The category can be set for each transaction by the user. Over time we learn which merchant goes in which category and auto-assign the category of a transaction. If the user hasn't set a category, we'll return the default category of the merchant on this transactions. Top-ups have category `mondo`. Valid values are `general`, `eating_out`, `expenses`, `transport`, `cash`, `bills`, `entertainment`, `shopping`, `holidays`, `groceries`.
`merchant`       | This contains the `merchant_id` of the merchant that this transaction was made at. Expanding merchant data is not supported via the AIS api.
